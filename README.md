# Detecting Cards in Poker Tournaments / Detekce karet při turnajích v pokru

This bachelor's thesis focuses on the development of an advanced system for automatic recognition and registration of playing cards from video recordings of poker games. The technology of convolutional neural networks, specifically the YOLO network, was chosen as the basic tool. It enables effective identification of cards on the table and in the hands of players even under challenging conditions. The work involved creating an extensive dataset for training and testing the card detector, which achieved a recognition accuracy of 98.7%. An algorithm was designed to minimize detector errors and improve the overall accuracy of the system. The results of the study suggest that the developed system has potential for use in practice.
